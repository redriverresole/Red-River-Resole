	<h1>Who We Are</h1>
</div>

<div class="col mission-section">
	<p>We are a group of rock climbers living just outside the Red River Gorge area who know how important it is for rock climbing shoe resoling to become an accessible option for climbers living in and visiting the area.</p>
	<p>We have heard about your struggles with the resoling process, determining if it's worth it to resole your shoes, determining if your shoes are salvageable, finding the right place to send your shoes, saving up multiple pairs to send, figuring out how to time the shipment in order to keep climbing, having to buy a new pair of shoes in the meantime, and we've even heard about people teaming up with other climbers and driving everyone's shoes to some place far away that might be able to help. We started Red Resole mostly because I wanted the option to have my shoes resoled, and then I thought other people might want that too. Why not have a resoling option here, so close to a climbing destination people all over the world love?</p>
	<p>Now, we are trying to figure out a way to make Red Resole a reality. And it's tough. But so are we. (I mean, we do climb.) So we are slowly but steadily getting ourselves figured out. We aren't resoling shoes yet, but we will be soon. Follow along on our journey of figuring out how starting a business and reconstructing climbing shoes actually works. We'd love your encouragement in the process. Again, it's pretty tough stuff. We hope we can fix up your shoes soon.</p>
